- title: The Best Sprint Coaching
  description: |
    Have you ever wondered which US universities have the best sprint coaching programs?
    Probably not, but I did, so I made this project to find out.
    Specifically, I wanted to see which teams do the best job of developing sprinters. Take a look!

    I had to take a test. I was tired of studying during vacation so I did what any reasonable person would do: 
    I made a Monte Carlo simulation to see if I could stop studying.

    This links directly out to my master's thesis, which I completed in 2025.
    I did a deep dive into interrater reliability of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for cancer tumor response.

- title: "{ordinalsimr}: My First R Package on CRAN" 
  description: |
    This is my first R package, which I developed and released on CRAN in 2025.
    It provides a Shiny application for simulating ordinal data, and running a variety of statistical tests suited for ordinal data.
    It was a challenging project that taught me a lot about R package development and Shiny applications
