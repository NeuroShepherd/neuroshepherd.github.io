    "text": "The Best Sprint Coaching\n\n\nHave you ever wondered which US universities have the best sprint coaching programs? Probably not, but I did, so I made this project to find out. Specifically, I wanted to see which teams do the best job of developing sprinters. Take a look! \n\n\nR\nSQLite\nwebscraping\nlinear mixed models\npatience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nHave I Studied Enough to Pass?\n\n\nI had to take a test. I was tired of studying during vacation so I did what any reasonable person would do: I made a Monte Carlo simulation to see if I could stop studying. \n\n\nR\nsimulations\nprobability\ndata visualization\nprocrastination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nMaster’s Thesis: Interrater Reliability of Cancer Tumor Response\n\n\nThis links directly out to my master’s thesis, which I completed in 2025.

It provides a Shiny application for simulating ordinal data, and running a variety of statistical tests suited for ordinal data. It was a challenging project that taught me a lot about R package development and Shiny applications \n\n\nR package\nShiny\ndevelopment\nCRAN\nordinal data\nsimulations\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
